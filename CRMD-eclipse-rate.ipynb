Follow the [Quarknet 2017 Eclipse site](https://sites.google.com/view/quarknet2017eclipse/home) for more info. If this is your first time using this, try the [5-minute Intro to Jupyter activity](./Intro_to_Jupyter.ipynb) first.  \n",

    "This Jupyter notebook was the brainchild of [Quarknet](https://quarknet.i2u2.org/) staffer Mark Adams, eclipse file output designed by Sudha Balakrishnan, Joel Griffith sorted out web access to the data files, and this notebook was designed by [Adam LaMee](https://adamlamee.github.io/) all for Quarknet's Eclipse 2017 Cosmic Ray Study. Thanks to the great folks at [MyBinder.org](https://beta.mybinder.org/) for making this notebook is interactive without you needing to install anything."
